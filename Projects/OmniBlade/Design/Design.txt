overall, I want to have a looting style of gameplay
the fights will be lightly randomly encountered and chests will have many monster-in-a-boxes.
if the player dies, they go back to the main menu
and you can only save outside of a dungeon

i think i'll make all dungeons accessible from the start, but in order to enter all but the first one, you have to use a key to get in which can be bought from a shop.
and whenever the player leaves the dungeon, the door is relocked.
higher level dungeons require more expensive keys
additionally, you can pay to recruit additional characters other than your main character.
these are strange design mechanics, but that's because the first game won't be story-based for scoping reasons.
I do need to decide on the theme for the game, too.

okay, there were once 13 elementally-differentiated demons that came together to destroy the world.
the heroes of yore came together to destroy them, however, they found that they could not be killed.
so instead they pushed them back into the ancient tomb from whence they came and locked them within.
it is rumored that the demons had hoarded vast treasures in the tomb.
as a treasure hunter, you received word that an alchemist who was researching the mysteries of the ancient seals was traveling to the gates. Additionally, one of the seals has already been broken.
you hear that other treasure hunters had picked up this word as well.
not believing in anything such as 'ancient demons', you decide to make the trip to investigate what treasures can be liberated by yours truly before anyone else.
mechanically, this will provide the player with 12 different doors to unlock and 13 elementally-differentiated labyrinths to explore.

in practice, that means i need to go ahead and design the tomb entrance area.
it will be an outside area with some tents propped up here and there containing traders as well as rival treasure hunters
each level will be themed around its associated demon theme - fire, ice, water, earth, castle, jungle, and so on.

"They became the rule makers by, ironically, breaking all the rules. They realized that - when all is said and done - only those who lie are believed, and only those who cheat, win. Those without power will always be regarded as contemptible. Those who reject power on principle, who speak truth to power, will be made the scapegoats of its worst evils. This is the world you live in, breathe in, swim in. It is an ocean of corruption."

that quote sounds pretty darn accurate to me

I'm thinking about putting it as a line the game.
I still haven't figured out a back story, so I'm taking fragments of my own thoughts and see if they will build a narrative.
This line explains how the 9 ancient demons came to power.
What I haven't yet figured out is how they were defeated.
Michael (aganm)Today at 11:55 AM
do you have a summary of the back story that you want to write?
bryaneddsToday at 11:56 AM
not really - it's still kicking around
the premise of the game is that you are a treasure hunter looting the recently-discovered tomb of 9 ancient demons
i have just enough story to make the game mechanics fit together
but I'm still working on the back story

"It's not the light that you see, it's the light that you be."
perhaps the heroes antithesis to the above.

"And should your light shine to bright or too long? It is inevitable that a demon of darkness will come to throw shade upon you..."
"Then remind that demon that, after his fleeting time in the world, he is hellbound. Tho time moves slow in the moment, as the season pass, we all reflect how the current year was shorter than that last."
"Constantly, we all accelerate to our ultimate place in the cosmos. Faster and faster we move toward it. When the demons is stripped of all his worldly treasures in death, all he will be left with is Judgment."
"Were you a light, or were you a shade upon lights?"
"At the end of all things, what else could possibly matter?"
