General
-------

- rendering bug: when player walks against wall in downward direction, the player sprite sometimes flashes over the wall! discovered in inner tomb just before save.
- (subjective perception) downward player face has a slight lemming look due to darker sprites being interpreted as part of the face.

Outer Tomb
----------

- tree shadows look awkward over the player.
- some sprites on sides of cave don't match against adjacent tiles, to an extent that looks unfinished.

Inner Tomb
----------

- cave opening sprites look fairly poor, the second one particularly misplaced.
- save sounds like two overlapping and somewhat disjunct sound effects.

Cave
----

- got into fight after leaving cave. bug or intentional?
- boss represented by pink half-square outline.

Battle
------

- old icons are still there.
- background changes to debug upon fade-out.
- sometimes hurricane attack doesn't cancel enemy lightning?
- is hurricane attack slowing performance or just slow?
