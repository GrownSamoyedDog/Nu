FP Works Repository
===================

This repository hosts several projects, including -

- ![Alt text](Nu/Promotional/Nu Icon.png?raw=true "Nu Game Engine"), the **Nu Game Engine**, a cross-platform F# 2D game engine built in the functional style. Uses SDL2 and Farseer Physics.
- the programming language **Aml**, a common language for building DSLs on top of using F#.
- the small but potentially useful F# code library **Prime** (interesting features, but lacks unit tests).
- the sample game **BlazeVector**.
- the game **OmniBlade** that I just barely started on (currently working to get funding for this).

Here is some media on the Nu Game Engine -

Finally, here's a video of some of BlazeVector's gameplay - https://github.com/bryanedds/FPWorks/blob/master/BlazeVector/Promotional/BlazeVector.mp4?raw=true

Getting Started
===============

The best way to get started is to pull down the repository with a git client, and to take a look at the following documents -

The current documentation for the **Nu Game Engine** is found here - https://github.com/bryanedds/FPWorks/blob/master/Nu/Documentation/Nu%20Game%20Engine.pdf?raw=true

The current documentation for the **Aml** programming language is found here - https://github.com/bryanedds/FPWorks/tree/master/Aml/Documentation

If you're looking at Aml, run the **AmlRepl project** from Visual Studio and follow its instructions (especially in studying the StdLib Aml code to get a real feel for the language).

Finally, please check out the license for this repository below!

Thanks all for checking out my work so far!

Sponsors
========

The **Nu Game Engine** is looking for sponsors! If you're interested in sponsoring development for what I hope will become **the world's first mainstream functional game engine**, please contact me at bryanedds@gmail.com . Otherwise, I'll just have to work on it in my spare time, which can be erratic :S

**OmniBlade** is also looking for sponsors!
